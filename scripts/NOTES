/rsgrps/bhurwitz/scottdaniel/fastq-taxoner-patric/sort-and-merged

has the .fastq's that have been QC'ed and filtered for host / host food genomes

first we will collapse them into sample groups (e.g. DNA_1, DNA_2)
second we will remove duplicates (with 'fastq filter' program)
third we will filter out reads with low-abundance kmers (with khmer program)
3.5 we will put reads back into paired-end and single-end files
fourth we will assemble each sample individually
fifth we will run QC on each assembly
sixth we will assemble the samples together
7th we will run QC on that co-assembly
